# Bratislava English Meetup  Code of Conduct

<p>We at Bratislava English Meetup believe our Community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all participants, free from discrimination for any reason including on the basis of gender identity, sex, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, age, and religion.</p>
<p>This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>We invite all leadership, sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, media, exhibitors, contributors, and other participants to help us realize a safe and positive community experience for everyone.</p>
<p>At an event, speakers are asked to frame discussions as openly and inclusively as possible and to be aware of how language or images may be perceived by others. Participants may – and do – exercise their option to leave a session or a conversation. Exhibitors must follow all Exhibits rules and regulations and event policies.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Behavior</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be considerate, respectful and collaborative.</li>
<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Your fellow participants may have a different level of comfort with respect to language and personal space.</li>
<li>Alert organizer if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unacceptable Behavior</strong></p>
<p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning conduct by any participants in the this community and related events. Some event venues are shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>

<p>Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated whether by other attendees, media, speakers, volunteers, organizers, venue staff, sponsors, or exhibitors.</p>
<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizer may take any action they deem appropriate, at their sole discretion, up to and including expulsion from the community or event without warning or refund.</p>
<p><strong>What to Do If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior</strong></p>
<p>If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the organizer as soon as possible. All reports will remain completely confidential.</p>

<p>At events, the organizer will be available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, to provide escorts, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe for the duration of the events.</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>We expect all community participants (leadership, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct at all online or in person events. Participants asked to stop a hostile or harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community participants seek to learn, network and have fun. Please do so responsibly and with respect for the right of others to do likewise.</p>
<p>Please contact organizer if you believe you have been harassed or that a harassment problem exists. Organizer will determine and carry out the appropriate course of action, and may consult with and engage other co-organizer, leaders, and legal counsel, as appropriate. Event security and/or local law enforcement may be involved, as appropriate, based on the specific circumstances. As requested, a follow-up report will be made to individuals who report being harassed.</p>
